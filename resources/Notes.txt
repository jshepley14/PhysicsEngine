Notes for implementation.

I need training data to adjust the variables. 
What's the fastest time I can do for checking an object which is floating?
This could be a certain classification of inputs, "floating" configurations. However if we could determine that already then we wouldn't need the simulator anyway right?

How fast is the simulator when you take away the drawing function?

What are some cases where there is a true case of static equilibrium?
I need those cases in order to find the right THRESHOLD value.
